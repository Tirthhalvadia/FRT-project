Project Title:
Monitor BPM of a person
 

Problem Statement/Opportunity:
Nowadays since healthcare is so advanced that we can monitor our health 24/7 using smart gadgets like our smart phone, smart watch etc. but if we can keep a track of our data using machine learning then it would revolutionize our lives and the way we live. So using the feature of machine learning present in Microsoft azure we can easily solve this problem. 


Project Description:
So the main idea behind this project is to target health care industry by using the existing technology to its fullest. So this is done by generating data out of the smart gadgets which can be later studied thoroughly to avoid health complications in future. So basically in this project I have created a machine learning model which is trained by adding data relevant to our needs and here, we have been feeding heart beats (BPM) data of a person which this model further studies and provide us with valuable information and trends. Studying these various trends and monitoring the graphs of data provided by Microsoft azure's Machine learning model help us overcome health risks and thus serves the purpose of changing our lifestyle forever. So in the end this project overcomes one of the biggest problem of not using the technologies to the fullest and thus making health care industry more efficient
